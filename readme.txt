I've choosed this dataset for many reasons one of them is related to my country vision. We don't have sharing bikes systems like this but in future we may have at least one system. Especially when the Metro government project will be on the land, then we need some systems and services like this.
 
In this Visualization I tried to focus on the trip duration and what type of users are using this service more than other by binding these results with the days on the week to try get something interesting to write an insight or recommend tips for whom are interested to this services

## Summary of findings:
 - Most users are subsrcibers, so systems need to focus on the offers to get more subscirber to have many beneficial interest.
 - Most trips were taken in days of work but for small period of time around 25 minutes.
 - peak hours are similar to all days of work, from 5 - 10  and from  15 - 22.
 - Weekend have small number of trips but they spend more time in all hours in a day
